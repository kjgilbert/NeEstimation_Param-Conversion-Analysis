This code accompanies the data stored on Dryad for [Gilbert and Whitlock (*In press*) Evaluating methods for estimating local effective population size with and without migration. *Evolution*.]() stored here: **insert Dryad DOI once becomes public**

See the Readme files contained within each subfolder. 

These are the input files used for nemo simulations (Ideal simulation raw files stored on Dryad; Migration and IBD raw simulation files are >80GB in size when compressed, and may be requested from KJ Gilbert via email). These input files contain the parameters used in Nemo v2.2.0 to create the raw population files from which individuals were sampled. 

R scripts for file conversion to the various program inputs as well as for analyzing the various outputs are also included.
