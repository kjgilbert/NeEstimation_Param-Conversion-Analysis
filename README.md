This code accompanies the [data stored on Dryad](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3r651) for Gilbert and Whitlock (*In press*) [Evaluating methods for estimating local effective population size with and without migration](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12713/abstract). *Evolution*.

See the Readme files contained within each subfolder. 

These are the input files that can be used to recreate the nemo simulations from which populations were sampled (Ideal simulation raw files stored on Dryad; Migration and IBD raw simulation files are >80GB in size when compressed, and may be requested from KJ Gilbert via email if the user does not wish to recreate them from input files here). These input files contain the parameters used in Nemo v2.2.0 to create the raw population files that were sampled. 

R scripts for file conversion to the various program inputs as well as for analyzing the various outputs are also included.
